| 138 | Contextual_gloss gate restricted to 13 polysemous Strong's IDs — should it be expanded? | ,  |
| 137 | Preposition morph_key lacks governed case — can't disambiguate πρός, ἐπί, κατά | ,  |
| 135 | refactor: Lexeme entity missing JPA fields for is_stative, is_deponent, is_polysemous |  |
| 134 | test: add tests for GlossChainService.resolveBatch() — use existing interlinear_bible_test DB with real data |  |
| 133 | docs: update DESIGN.md to reflect current implementation (contextual_gloss, TokenDto, schema V45) |  |
| 132 | bug: import pipeline creates duplicate lexeme rows when lemma lookup misses existing strongs_id |  |
| 129 | Test infrastructure: PostgreSQL test database for integration tests |  |
| 128 | DX: Enforce read-only psql access for Claude Code via DB user and settings deny rules |  |
| 127 | morphKey mapped incorrectly for demonstrative pronouns — posCode D maps to 'adverb' |  |
| 126 | Fix pre-existing test failures exposed by data.sql canonical_word removal |  |
| 125 | Hide CorpusEditor — lexeme_meaning must not be editable from the UI |  |
| 124 | Add audit log to sensitive DB tables and read-only DB user for Claude Code |  |
| 123 | LITE Gloss Override writes to wrong layer — cannot override contextual_gloss (#123) |  |
| 122 | AI-generated glosses write bad data to DB with no audit trail (#122) |  |
| 121 | feat: AI translation strip — display as readable passage block, not per-verse inline |  |
| 120 | feat: configurable AI provider — not hardcoded to Groq |  |

| 115 | Migrate primary dev workspace to VS Code (D:\workspace-vscode) |  |
| 114 | Research and implement test suite for primary functionality | ,  |
| 112 | Performance: reader loads full chapter when only a single verse is needed |  |

| 108 | Language selector not working in Docker deploy | ,  |
| 107 | Claude Code: bad advice and wrong implementations cost tokens with no refund | ,  |
